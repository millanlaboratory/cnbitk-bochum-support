Installation python modules:
- Go to the python folder (e.g., python/Feedback)
- Run 'python setup.py'
- Export the following environment variables (where @PREFIX@ is the installation
  directory provided during configuration (e.g., ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Local/):

		export CNBITK_PYTHON_LIB=@PREFIX@/lib/cnbipython/
		export CNBITK_PYTHON_DATA=@PREFIX@/share/cnbipython/
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:@PREFIX@/lib/cnbipython/

		(This line can be added also to your $HOME/.profile, thus logout is
		required)
